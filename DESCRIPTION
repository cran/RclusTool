Description: Graphical toolbox for clustering and classification of data frames.
    It proposes a graphical interface to process clustering and classification methods on features
    data-frames, and to view initial data as well as resulted cluster or classes. According to the
    level of available labels, different approaches are proposed: unsupervised clustering,
    semi-supervised clustering and supervised classification. 
    To assess the processed clusters or classes, the toolbox can import and show some supplementary
    data formats: either profile/time series, or images. 
    These added information can help the expert to label clusters (clustering), or to constrain data
    frame rows (semi-supervised clustering), using Constrained spectral embedding algorithm by 
    Wacquet et al. (2013) <doi:10.1016/j.patrec.2013.02.003> and the methodology provided by 
    Wacquet et al. (2013) <doi:10.1007/978-3-642-35638-4_21>.
